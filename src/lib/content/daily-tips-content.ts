        "CIP Conductivity Drift: Caustic soda hawa se CO2 soakh kar kharab ho jata hai. Meter ko lagta hai concentration sahi hai, par tank saaf nahi hota.",
        "Membrane Scaling (White): RO membrane par safed pathar (Calcium) jamta hai. Ise Acid se saaf karo. Agar pehle Alkali dala to ye pathar pakka ho jayega.",
        "Membrane Biofouling (Slimy): Membrane par chipchipi parat. Isse pressure badh jata hai. Iske liye Enzyme ya Oxidizer chahiye.",
        "Air Locks in Pasteurizers: Agar pump ne hawa kheech li, to wo pasteurizer ke upar fans jati hai. Waha 'Hot Spot' ban jata hai aur doodh jalne lagta hai.",
        "Chiller Approach Temperature: Doodh aur Glycol ke temperature ka fark. Agar ye fark badhta ja raha hai, matlab chiller ki plates gandi ho gayi hain.",
        "Boiler Carryover: Agar boiler ka pani jhaag banaye, to chemicals steam ke saath doodh mein aa sakte hain. Ye dangerous hai.",
        "Homogenizer Valve Chatter: Agar 'kat-kat' ki awaaz aaye, to valve ghis gaya hai ya spring toot gayi hai. Doodh bina toote nikal raha hai.",
        "Separator Bowl Balance: Agar bowl mein ek taraf 10g kachra bhi reh gaya, to 6000 RPM par wo bearings tod dega.",
        "Vacuum Leaks: Siti bajne ki awaaz. Leak se doodh ka boiling point badh jata hai aur wo jalne lagta hai. Ultrasonic detector se dhundo.",
        "Stray Voltage: Agar earthing sahi nahi hai, to pipe ke jod (joints) par bijli se ched (pitting) ho jate hain.",
        "Gasket Compression Set: Clamp ko bohot zyada kasne se gasket ki lachak khatam ho jati hai. Garam/Thanda hone par wo leak karne lagta hai.",
        "Lubrication Washout: Conveyor bearings par high-pressure pani maarne se grease nikal jati hai. Sealed bearings use karo.",
        "Sensor Drift: Temperature sensor samay ke saath galat batane lagta hai. 0.5°C ki galti bhi doodh ko kacha rakh sakti hai. Calibration zaroori hai.",
        "Filter Integrity Test: Sterile tank ke hawa wale filter ko test karna padta hai. Ek chota ched pure tank ko kharab kar sakta hai.",
        "Water Hammer Arrestors: Lambe pipes mein shock absorbers lagane chahiye taaki valve band hone ka jhatka gasket na phade.",
        "Glycol Concentration: Agar glycol patla ho gaya (pani milne se), to wo 'Slush' ban jayega aur pump ko jam kar dega.",

        "Flavor Threshold Values: Wo limit jaha 50% log khushboo soongh sakein. Diacetyl (makkhan) ki limit bohot kam hoti hai, jabki Lactose (meetha) ki bohot zyada.",
        "Flavor Masking: Zyada fat jeebh par parat bana leta hai aur swaad rok deta hai. Isliye low-fat ice cream ka vanilla zyada tez lagta hai.",
        "Lipid-Derived Off-Flavors: 'Fishy' matlab Omega-3 kharab hua. 'Cardboard' matlab Nonanal bana. 'Paint' matlab Pentanal bana.",
        "Lightstruck Flavor (Methional): Dhoop mein 20 minute rehne par Amino acid toot kar Methional banta hai. Iski badboo 'uble hue patta gobhi' jaisi hoti hai.",
        "Diacetyl Reduction: Dahi mein bacteria Diacetyl (acha) banate hain. Par agar zyada der rakha to wo use Acetoin (beswaad) bana dete hain.",
        "Acetaldehyde Balance: Dahi mein Hara Seb (Acetaldehyde) aur Makkhan (Diacetyl) ka balance hona chahiye. Agar bigda to kache kaddu jaisa swaad aayega.",
        "Trigeminal Sensations: Ye swaad nahi, ehsaas hain. Astringency (rookha-pan), Cooling (thanda-pan), Burn (jalan).",
        "Sweetness Potency: Thandi ice cream mein mithaas kam lagti hai. Isliye ice cream mein 15% zyada chini dalni padti hai.",
        "Flavor Release Rates: Fruit flavors jaldi aate hain (Panic). Chocolate/Vanilla der mein aate hain (Fat soluble).",
        "Iso-valeric Acid: Ye 'Paseene wale moze' jaisi badboo hai. Pecorino cheese mein ye achi maani jati hai, par Cheddar mein ye defect hai.",
        "Catty Taint: Agar epoxy paint aur doodh ka sulfur mil jaye, to 'Billi ki peshab' jaisi badboo aati hai.",
        "Phenolic Taint: Chlorine sanitizer agar Phenol se mil jaye, to 'Hospital' ya 'Band-Aid' jaisi smell aati hai.",
        "Scorched Particle Flavor: Agar doodh se jale hue kaale kan channi se nikal bhi do, tab bhi 'Raakh' (ashy) jaisa swaad reh jata hai.",
        "Feed Taints Transference: Agar gaay ne jungli pyaaz khayi, to 30 minute mein doodh mein badboo aa jayegi. Vacuum treatment hi iska ilaj hai.",
        "Rancid vs Oxidized: Rancid = Sabun/Ulti (Hydrolysis). Oxidized = Metal/Gatta (Oxidation). Dono ka ilaj alag hai.",
        "Salty-Sweet Suppression: Chocolate milk mein namak dalne se kadwahat kam hoti hai aur mithaas badhti hai.",
        "Umami in Cheese: Aged cheese mein Glutamic acid ke crystals 'Umami' swaad dete hain. Isse muh mein pani aata hai.",
        "Warmed-Over Flavor: Doodh ki dish dobara garam karne par fat oxidation se 'basi' swaad aata hai jo fresh mein nahi hota.",
        "Chemical Taints: Dahi ke plastic cup se Styrene chemical nikal sakta hai, jo plastic jaisa taste deta hai.",
        "Sensory Fatigue: 5 masaledar cheese chakne ke baad jeebh sunn ho jati hai. Beech mein plain cracker khana zaroori hai."

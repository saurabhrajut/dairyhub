      p1: "Doodh ek atyant nashwar (perishable) product hai jis mein naturally present enzymes, microorganisms, aur reactive chemical compounds hote hain jo ise rapidly spoil karte hain. Doodh ki initial quality ko ek pre-determined samay tak preserve karne ke liye suitable packaging absolutely essential hai. India mein produce hone wale kul doodh ka sirf 15% commercial dairy industry dwara pack kiya jaata hai — baaki 72% unorganized sector se directly consumers tak pahunchta hai bina kisi proper packaging ke. Iska directly public health par negative impact padta hai.",
      p2: "Flexible pouch abhi bhi kul dairy marketing ka lagbhag 92% hissa hai, lekin India ka dairy packaging market 8-10% CAGR se grow kar raha hai aseptic packaging, UHT technology, aur modern retail infrastructure ke expansion ke saath. Packaging food safety management system (jaise HACCP, ISO 22000, SQF) mein ek critical <strong>Prerequisite Program (PRP)</strong> hai — yeh product ko physical (glass, metal fragments), chemical (lubricants, cleaning agents), aur microbiological contamination se protect karta hai.",
      p3: "Packaging material selection ek multi-criteria decision hai jisme product type, required shelf life, processing method (pasteurized vs. UHT vs. retort), distribution temperature (ambient vs. cold chain), transportation distance, consumer preference, regulatory compliance (FSSAI, BIS, FDA), cost economics, aur environmental sustainability sab ko simultaneously consider karna padta hai. Galat packaging selection se product spoilage, food safety incidents, economic losses, aur brand damage ho sakta hai.",

      purposes: [
        "<strong>Protection (Suraksha):</strong> Product ko physical damage (mechanical shock, vibration, compression, abrasion), chemical degradation (oxidation, hydrolysis, enzymatic reactions), aur microbiological contamination se comprehensive protection dena. Drop test (60-120 cm height), compression test (stacking load), aur vibration simulation tests packaging ki protection capability verify karte hain. Primary, secondary, aur tertiary packaging levels milke ek complete protection system form karte hain.",
        "<strong>Preservation (Paridaan):</strong> Oxygen, light, moisture, gases (CO₂, N₂), microorganisms, aur external odors se effective barrier provide karna. Oxygen lipid oxidation promote karta hai jisse rancid flavors develop hote hain. Light (UV aur visible) riboflavin degradation, vitamin A loss, aur photo-oxidized off-flavors cause karta hai. Moisture gain ya loss product texture, consistency, aur weight ko affect karta hai. Barrier properties ko OTR (Oxygen Transmission Rate), WVTR (Water Vapor Transmission Rate), aur light transmission % se quantify kiya jaata hai.",
        "<strong>Presentation & Promotion:</strong> Package consumer ka attention attract karta hai aur purchasing decision mein crucial role play karta hai. 7 seconds ka 'first impression' rule packaging design par apply hota hai — ismein color psychology, typography, imagery, aur shelf appeal include hain. FSSAI mandatory labeling (product name, net quantity, MRP, manufacturing date, expiry date, FSSAI license number, nutritional information, allergen declaration, ingredients) legal compliance ensure karta hai. Smart packaging mein QR codes, augmented reality features, aur anti-counterfeiting elements shamil hain.",
        "<strong>Portability & Convenience:</strong> Consumer ease of handling, easy opening mechanisms (tear notches, peel tabs), re-sealability (zip locks, screw caps), portion control (single-serve packaging), microwave safety, stackability, aur tamper-evident features modern consumer demands hain. Ergonomic design consumer injuries prevent karta hai aur product wastage minimize karta hai.",
        "<strong>Planet (Sustainability):</strong> Circular economy principles ke anusaar — Reduce (packaging material weight minimize karna, lightweighting), Reuse (refillable glass bottles, multi-trip containers), Recycle (mono-material structures jo easily recyclable hain), aur Recover (energy recovery from non-recyclable packaging) — packaging design karna zaroori hai. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) India mein legally mandated hai."

Information English ya Hindi (Devnagri script) mein — ya jis state mein sold ho uski official language mein — clearly legible font mein honi chahiye. Mandatory elements: product name, net quantity (by weight/volume), list of ingredients (descending order by weight), nutritional information (per 100g/100ml), date of manufacture, best before/use by date, batch/lot number, FSSAI license number of manufacturer, manufacturer/packer/importer address, country of origin (imports ke liye), aur allergen declaration.",
      milk_spoilage: "Doodh mein Spoilage ke Scientific Kaaran: Fresh raw milk mein initially 10³-10⁴ CFU/mL bacteria hote hain. Inka primary source hota hai udder, teat surface, milking equipment, aur environment. Major spoilage organisms: Pseudomonas (psychrotrophic, grows at 4°C), Bacillus (spore-forming, heat-resistant), Clostridium, Lactobacillus. Spoilage mechanisms include: proteolysis (casein breakdown → bitter flavor, curdling), lipolysis (fat hydrolysis → rancid/soapy taste), lactose fermentation (lactic acid production → souring), aur Maillard browning (amino acid + reducing sugar → browning, cooked flavor at high temperature). Proper packaging in combination with correct temperature control, pasteurization/UHT, aur hygienic processing inhe effectively control karta hai."

Yeh 100% impermeable barrier provide karta hai gases (O₂, CO₂, N₂), moisture, aur vapors ke liye — OTR aur WVTR practically zero hain. Glass ki surface non-porous hoti hai jo microbial adhesion prevent karti hai. Taste, aroma, aur purity perfectly preserved hoti hai. Glass repeatedly sterilized ho sakta hai 120°C+ par bina degradation ke.",
        p2: "Glass ki limitations scientifically significant hain: Density approximately 2.5 g/cm³ hoti hai, ek 1-liter bottle ka weight 450-550g hota hai jo net product weight se adhik ho sakta hai — transportation cost dramatically increase karta hai. Brittle fracture tendency (fracture toughness: ~0.7-0.9 MPa·m^0.5) handling aur transportation mein breakage risk create karta hai. Thermal shock resistance limited hai — sudden temperature changes (>40°C differential) cracks/breakage cause karte hain. Transparency UV aur visible light transmission allow karti hai jo riboflavin degradation (peak absorption: 440-460 nm) aur photo-oxidized flavors cause karti hai — isliye amber glass (cuts UV <450 nm) ya opaque labels prefer kiye jaate hain. Kulled glass manufacturing energy-intensive process hai.",
        p3: "India mein sterilized flavoured milk, lassi, aur dahi abhi bhi heat-resistant glass bottles (IS 1392-1967 Type I/II) mein pack hote hain 200ml-500ml capacity mein. Returnable glass bottles (RGB system) dairy cooperatives mein — jaise Amul, Verka — use hote hain jahan collection infrastructure available ho. Ek glass bottle 25-30 times reuse ho sakti hai proper multi-stage cleaning (caustic wash 2% NaOH at 75°C → water rinse → acid rinse → final rinse → inspection → filling) ke baad. Glass 100% infinitely recyclable hai bina quality loss ke."

Yeh lightweight (density 0.90-1.05 g/cm³), mechanically versatile, process-friendly (heat-sealable, thermoformable, blow-moldable), aur cost-effective hote hain. FDA 21 CFR aur BIS standards ke anusaar food-grade formulations use kiye jaate hain jisme no harmful additives/plasticizers hote hain.",
        types: [
          "<h4>LDPE — Low-Density Polyethylene (Pasteurized Milk Pouches)</h4> Molecular structure: highly branched long-chain polymer. Density: 0.910-0.925 g/cm³. Highly amorphous structure provides: excellent flexibility (elongation at break: 300-500%), good impact resistance, aur outstanding heat-sealing properties (seal initiation temperature: 110-120°C, seal strength: 15-30 N/15mm). Moisture barrier acceptable (WVTR: 15-20 g/m²/day at 38°C). Oxygen barrier poor (OTR: 7000-8500 cc/m²/day/atm at 23°C) — suitable sirf short shelf-life products (4-5 days refrigerated) ke liye. MI (Melt Index): 0.3-2.0 g/10min for film grade. Standard milk pouch thickness: 60µ (200ml), 75µ (500ml), 100µ (1L). Meets IS 2508 requirements.",
          "<h4>LLDPE — Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (High-Performance Pouches)</h4> Molecular structure: linear backbone with short, uniform branches (co-monomers: butene C4, hexene C6, octene C8). Density: 0.915-0.930 g/cm³. Superior mechanical properties vs. LDPE: Tensile strength: 40-55 MPa (2x LDPE), Puncture resistance: 4-8x better (dart drop impact: 150-400g vs LDPE 80-150g), tear resistance: 30-50% higher. These properties allow downgauging (thinner films) by 15-25% while maintaining performance. Blended with LDPE in 20-80% ratio to optimize processability-performance balance. Coefficient of friction (COF): 0.2-0.4 for good machinability. LLDPE/LDPE blend pouches now dominating pasteurized milk market.",
          "<h4>HDPE — High-Density Polyethylene (Bottles & Rigid Containers)</h4> Molecular structure: highly linear, minimal branching (co-monomer <2%). Density: 0.941-0.965 g/cm³, high crystallinity (70-80%). Semi-rigid to rigid material with excellent stiffness (flexural modulus: 800-1500 MPa), good chemical resistance, aur better moisture barrier than LDPE/LLDPE (WVTR: 5-10 g/m²/day). Temperature resistance: -40°C to 120°C continuous service. Used for 500ml-2L milk bottles, cream containers, ghee containers, cap manufacture. Natural (unpigmented) HDPE transmits UV light — TiO₂ pigmentation (0.5-2%) provides light barrier for light-sensitive products. HDPE recyclability excellent — HDPE #2 widely accepted in recycling programs.",
          "<h4>PET — Polyethylene Terephthalate (Premium Clear Bottles)</h4> Semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic. Density: 1.33-1.40 g/cm³. Excellent optical clarity (haze <5%), high tensile strength (55-75 MPa), rigid yet lightweight (1L PET bottle: 25-40g vs glass: 450-550g — 90% weight reduction). Thermal properties: Tg = 70-80°C, Tm = 255-265°C. Oxygen barrier moderate (OTR: 50-100 cc/m²/day/atm for 200µm) — acceptable for 30-60 days refrigerated products. Excellent chemical resistance aur FDA-approved food contact. Transparent PET allows light transmission — UV-blocking additives ya opaque labels required. Biaxial orientation during blow molding increases barrier by 2-3x vs amorphous PET. PET #1 most widely recycled plastic globally.",
          "<h4>PP — Polypropylene (Yogurt Cups & Microwave Containers)</h4> Semi-crystalline polyolefin. Density: 0.900-0.910 g/cm³ (lightest common packaging plastic). Excellent heat resistance: Tm = 160-170°C, continuous service to 120°C — withstands retort (121°C) aur microwave heating. Stiffness: flexural modulus 1000-1700 MPa. Good chemical resistance, low moisture absorption, aur FDA/BIS food contact approval. Injection molded PP cups for yogurt (80-500g), dahi, shrikhand, mishti doi. PP thin-wall injection molding (IML — In-Mold Labeling technology) enables premium decoration without secondary labeling. PP #5 recyclable but collection infrastructure in India limited.",
          "<h4>PS — Polystyrene & HIPS (Yogurt Cups & Thermoformed Trays)</h4> Amorphous polymer. GPPS (General Purpose PS): transparent, brittle, density 1.04-1.06 g/cm³. HIPS (High Impact PS): rubber-toughened, opaque white, better impact resistance (10-40 kJ/m² vs GPPS <2 kJ/m²). Thermoforming characteristics excellent — deep draw capability, good detail reproduction. Oxygen barrier poor (OTR: 1500-3000 cc/m²/day/atm). Used for 50ml-1kg dahi, yogurt, ice cream cups with Al-PE peelable foil lids. Disadvantage: not microwave safe (max service temp ~85°C), poor chemical resistance to fats/oils at elevated temperature. PS #6 recyclability poor in India."

Vinyl alcohol content (38-48 mol%) determines barrier — higher EVOH content = better O₂ barrier. Critical limitation: EVOH is highly moisture-sensitive — barrier degrades significantly at high humidity. Solution: always sandwiched between moisture-barrier layers (PE/EVOH/PE multilayer structure).

Distribution packaging must be validated for actual supply chain conditions using ISTA (International Safe Transit Association) protocols: random vibration simulation, shock/drop sequence, aur temperature cycling.",
      nanotechnology: "Nanotechnology in Dairy Packaging: Nano-composite packaging — clay nanoparticles (montmorillonite, MMT) incorporated in polymer matrix create tortuous path for gas molecules, improving barrier by 2-5× without compromising transparency or recyclability. Nanosilver antimicrobial coatings — silver nanoparticles (10-100 nm) on packaging surface slowly release Ag⁺ ions with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Nano-titanium dioxide (TiO₂) photocatalytic coatings — UV light activation generates reactive oxygen species destroying surface bacteria. Regulatory status: nanomaterials in food contact materials under scrutiny — EFSA aur FSSAI evaluation ongoing. Migration of nanoparticles into food is primary safety concern."

    introduction: {
      title: "Introduction and Objectives of Dairy Packaging",
      p1: "Milk is an extremely perishable biological product containing naturally present enzymes, microorganisms, and reactive chemical compounds that cause rapid spoilage. Suitable packaging is absolutely essential to preserve milk's initial quality for a predetermined shelf life. Currently, only about 15% of total milk produced in India is packaged by the commercial dairy industry — the remaining 72% reaches consumers through the unorganized sector without proper packaging, with direct negative implications for public health.",
      p2: "Flexible pouches currently account for approximately 92% of all commercial dairy marketing, but India's dairy packaging market is growing at 8-10% CAGR driven by expansion of aseptic packaging, UHT technology, and modern retail infrastructure. Packaging is a critical <strong>Prerequisite Program (PRP)</strong> in food safety management systems (HACCP, ISO 22000, SQF) — protecting products from physical (glass, metal fragments), chemical (lubricants, cleaning agents), and microbiological contamination.",
      p3: "Packaging material selection is a multi-criteria decision requiring simultaneous consideration of: product type, required shelf life, processing method (pasteurized vs. UHT vs. retort), distribution temperature (ambient vs. cold chain), transportation distance, consumer preferences, regulatory compliance (FSSAI, BIS), cost economics, and environmental sustainability. Incorrect packaging selection leads to product spoilage, food safety incidents, economic losses, and brand damage.",
      purpose_title: "Five Primary Functions of Packaging (5 P's of Packaging)",
      purposes: [
        "<strong>Protection:</strong> Comprehensive protection from physical damage (mechanical shock, vibration, compression, abrasion), chemical degradation (oxidation, hydrolysis, enzymatic reactions), and microbiological contamination. Drop tests (60-120 cm), compression tests (stacking load), and vibration simulation tests verify packaging protection capabilities. Primary, secondary, and tertiary packaging levels together form a complete protection system.",
        "<strong>Preservation:</strong> Providing effective barriers against oxygen, light, moisture, gases (CO₂, N₂), microorganisms, and external odors. Oxygen promotes lipid oxidation causing rancid flavors. Light (UV and visible) causes riboflavin degradation, vitamin A loss, and photo-oxidized off-flavors. Moisture gain or loss affects product texture, consistency, and weight. Barrier properties are quantified by OTR, WVTR, and light transmission percentage.",
        "<strong>Presentation & Promotion:</strong> Packages attract consumer attention and play a crucial role in purchasing decisions. The '7-second first impression' rule applies to packaging design — encompassing color psychology, typography, imagery, and shelf appeal. FSSAI mandatory labeling (product name, net quantity, MRP, dates, FSSAI license number, nutritional information, allergen declaration, ingredients) ensures legal compliance. Smart packaging includes QR codes, augmented reality features, and anti-counterfeiting elements.",
        "<strong>Portability & Convenience:</strong> Consumer ease of handling, easy opening mechanisms (tear notches, peel tabs), re-sealability (zip locks, screw caps), portion control (single-serve), microwave safety, stackability, and tamper-evident features are modern consumer requirements. Ergonomic design prevents consumer injuries and minimizes product wastage.",
        "<strong>Planet (Sustainability):</strong> Packaging design following circular economy principles — Reduce (minimize packaging material weight/lightweighting), Reuse (refillable glass bottles, multi-trip containers), Recycle (mono-material structures easily recyclable), and Recover (energy recovery from non-recyclable packaging) — is essential. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) is legally mandated in India under Plastic Waste Management Rules 2021."
      ],
      p4: "Complete labeling is mandatory per FSSAI Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations 2020. All mandatory information must be in English or Hindi (Devnagri script), or the official language of the state where sold, in clearly legible font. Mandatory elements include: product name, net quantity, complete ingredients list (descending order by weight), nutritional information (per 100g/100ml), manufacturing date, best before/use by date, batch/lot number, FSSAI license number, manufacturer/packer address, country of origin (for imports), and allergen declaration.",
      milk_spoilage: "Scientific Causes of Milk Spoilage: Fresh raw milk initially contains 10³-10⁴ CFU/mL bacteria from udder, teat surfaces, milking equipment, and environment. Major spoilage organisms: Pseudomonas (psychrotrophic, grows at 4°C), Bacillus (spore-forming, heat-resistant), Clostridium, Lactobacillus. Spoilage mechanisms include: proteolysis (casein breakdown → bitter flavor, curdling), lipolysis (fat hydrolysis → rancid/soapy taste), lactose fermentation (lactic acid → souring), and Maillard browning (amino acid + reducing sugar → browning at high temperature). Proper packaging combined with correct temperature control, pasteurization/UHT, and hygienic processing effectively controls these mechanisms."

      title: "Different Dairy Packaging Materials",
      intro: "Dairy packaging material selection is based on specific product requirements — including processing temperature resistance, barrier properties, mechanical strength, food contact safety, cost economics, and environmental impact. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly important in material selection decisions.",
      glass: {
        title: "Glass — Traditional Premium Packaging",
        p1: "Glass (Type I borosilicate or Type III soda-lime glass per IS 1392) is completely chemically inert — it does not react with milk under any conditions. It provides a 100% impermeable barrier to gases (O₂, CO₂, N₂), moisture, and vapors — OTR and WVTR are practically zero. The non-porous surface prevents microbial adhesion. Taste, aroma, and purity are perfectly preserved. Glass can be repeatedly sterilized at 120°C+ without degradation.",
        p2: "Glass limitations are scientifically significant: density approximately 2.5 g/cm³ means a 1-liter bottle weighs 450-550g — more than the net product — dramatically increasing transportation costs. Brittle fracture tendency (fracture toughness: ~0.7-0.9 MPa·m^0.5) creates breakage risk during handling and transportation. Thermal shock resistance is limited — sudden temperature changes (>40°C differential) cause cracking/breakage. Transparency allows UV and visible light transmission causing riboflavin degradation (peak absorption: 440-460 nm) and photo-oxidized flavors — hence amber glass (cuts UV <450 nm) or opaque labels are preferred.",
        p3: "In India, sterilized flavoured milk, lassi, and dahi are still packaged in heat-resistant glass bottles (IS 1392-1967 Type I/II) in 200ml-500ml capacities. Returnable glass bottles (RGB system) are used in dairy cooperatives where collection infrastructure exists. A glass bottle can be reused 25-30 times with proper multi-stage cleaning (caustic wash 2% NaOH at 75°C → water rinse → acid rinse → final rinse → inspection → filling). Glass is 100% infinitely recyclable without quality loss."

      plastics: {
        title: "Plastic Materials — Dominant Dairy Packaging",
        p1: "Plastic packaging materials — primarily polyolefins (LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE) and engineering plastics (PET, PP, PS) — hold 92%+ market share in Indian dairy packaging. They are lightweight (density 0.90-1.05 g/cm³), mechanically versatile, process-friendly (heat-sealable, thermoformable, blow-moldable), and cost-effective. Food-grade formulations per FDA 21 CFR and BIS standards contain no harmful additives or plasticizers.",

Moisture barrier acceptable (WVTR: 15-20 g/m²/day at 38°C). Oxygen barrier poor (OTR: 7000-8500 cc/m²/day/atm at 23°C) — suitable only for short shelf-life products (4-5 days refrigerated). Standard milk pouch thickness: 60µ (200ml), 75µ (500ml), 100µ (1L). Meets IS 2508 requirements.",
          "<h4>LLDPE — Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (High-Performance Pouches)</h4> Molecular structure: linear backbone with short, uniform branches (co-monomers: butene C4, hexene C6, octene C8). Density: 0.915-0.930 g/cm³. Superior mechanical properties vs. LDPE: Tensile strength: 40-55 MPa (2× LDPE), Puncture resistance: 4-8× better (dart drop impact: 150-400g vs LDPE 80-150g), tear resistance 30-50% higher. These properties allow downgauging (thinner films) by 15-25% while maintaining performance. Blended with LDPE in 20-80% ratio to optimize processability-performance balance.",
          "<h4>HDPE — High-Density Polyethylene (Bottles & Rigid Containers)</h4> Molecular structure: highly linear, minimal branching (<2% co-monomer).

          "<h4>PET — Polyethylene Terephthalate (Premium Clear Bottles)</h4> Semi-crystalline engineering thermoplastic. Density: 1.33-1.40 g/cm³. Excellent optical clarity (haze <5%), high tensile strength (55-75 MPa), rigid yet lightweight (1L PET bottle: 25-40g vs glass: 450-550g — 90% weight reduction). Thermal properties: Tg = 70-80°C, Tm = 255-265°C. Oxygen barrier moderate (OTR: 50-100 cc/m²/day/atm for 200µm) — acceptable for 30-60 days refrigerated. Biaxial orientation during blow molding increases barrier 2-3×. PET #1 most widely recycled plastic globally.",
          "<h4>PP — Polypropylene (Yogurt Cups & Microwave Containers)</h4> Semi-crystalline polyolefin. Density: 0.900-0.910 g/cm³ (lightest common packaging plastic). Excellent heat resistance: Tm = 160-170°C, continuous service to 120°C — withstands retort (121°C) and microwave heating. Stiffness: flexural modulus 1000-1700 MPa. Used for injection-molded yogurt cups (80-500g), dahi, shrikhand. In-Mold Labeling (IML) enables premium decoration.",
          "<h4>PS — Polystyrene & HIPS (Yogurt Cups & Thermoformed Trays)</h4> Amorphous polymer. GPPS: transparent, brittle, density 1.04-1.06 g/cm³. HIPS (rubber-toughened): opaque white, impact resistance 10-40 kJ/m² vs GPPS <2 kJ/m². Excellent thermoforming characteristics. Poor oxygen barrier (OTR: 1500-3000 cc/m²/day/atm).

Impact categories: Global Warming Potential (kg CO₂ equivalent), water consumption (L), energy use (MJ), land use (m²), aur eutrophication potential. Key insight: Dairy product's environmental impact is dominated by agricultural production (70-80% of total impact) — packaging ka relative contribution 3-7% hota hai.

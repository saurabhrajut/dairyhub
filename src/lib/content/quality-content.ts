Dairy industry bhi ab in tareekon ko apna rahi hai taaki doodh aur doodh se bane products ki safety bani rahe. Food regulatory bodies ne bhi doodh aur doodh se bane products ke liye sakht kanoon aur standards banaye hain. Ab food safety sirf export hone wale products tak hi seemit nahi hai, balki gharelu (domestic) market aur consumers ke liye bhi zaroori hai.

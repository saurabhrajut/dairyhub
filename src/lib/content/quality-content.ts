Food supply chains ke ekikaran (integration) ke liye ab food safety sunishchit karne ke naye tareeke chahiye. Dairy industry bhi ab in tareekon ko apna rahi hai taaki doodh aur doodh se bane products ki safety bani rahe. Food regulatory bodies ne bhi doodh aur doodh se bane products ke liye sakht kanoon aur standards banaye hain. Ab food safety sirf export hone wale products tak hi seemit nahi hai, balki gharelu (domestic) market aur consumers ke liye bhi zaroori hai. Isliye, public aur private sector dono ne apne production process ko nayi technologies ke saath badla hai aur product safety ke liye sakht kanoon lagoo kiye hain.",

The integration of the food supply chains now requires newer approaches to ensure food safety. The dairy industry nowadays is also adopting some of these approaches to ensure the safety of the milk and milk products being produced. Food regulatory bodies have also formulated strict laws and standards for milk and milk products. Food safety is now not only limited to the products being exported but also to the domestic market and consumers. So in response to the food safety concept, the public and the private sector have now modified their production process with adoption of newer technologies and have also applied stringent laws to ensure product safety.",

Food supply chains के integration के लिए अब food safety sunishchit karne ke naye tarike chahiye. Dairy industry भी अब इन tarikon को अपना रहा है ताकि milk aur milk products की safety bani rahe. Food regulatory bodies ने भी milk aur milk products के लिए sakht kanoon aur standards banaye hain. Ab food safety sirf export hone wale products tak hi seemit nahi hai, balki domestic market aur consumers ke liye bhi zaroori hai. Isliye, public aur private sector dono ne apne production process ko nayi technologies ke saath badla hai aur product safety ke liye sakht kanoon laagoo kiye hain.",
    intro2: "Ek product की safety और quality पूरी chain में, yani pashu के than (udder) से लेकर consumer तक ya 'farm to fork', sunishchit ki jaani chahiye. Doodh ek jaldi kharab hone wali cheez hai aur ismein environmental factors ya kharab agricultural practices ki vajah se contamination ka khatra zyada hota hai. Isliye doodh utpadakon aur industry ke logon ko iski safety aur quality banaye rakhne ke liye bahut saavdhan rehna padta hai, khas karke jahan infrastructure theek na ho.",

    intro1: "With the advent of food safety concepts due to the liberalization of the food industry, the quality of the food products being produced is of utmost importance. The integration of the food supply chains now requires newer approaches to ensure food safety. The dairy industry nowadays is also adopting some of these approaches to ensure the safety of the milk and milk products being produced. Food regulatory bodies have also formulated strict laws and standards for milk and milk products. Food safety is now not only limited to the products being exported but also to the domestic market and consumers. So in response to the food safety concept, the public and the private sector have now modified their production process with adoption of newer technologies and have also applied stringent laws to ensure product safety.",
    intro2: "Safety and quality of a product must be ensured in the entire chain involved in the production, i.e., from the udder to the consumer or from farm to fork. Milk being a highly perishable commodity and being at a higher risk to get contaminated by either environmental factors or due to poor farm practices demands high care from milk producers and the industrial persons to ensure its safety and quality, especially where the infrastructure is not proper.",

Most outbreaks of Salmonella are traced back to dairy, poultry and meat products. Salmonella have the necessary tools and mechanisms to spread in the body. Microbiological control in the food industry plays a critical role in preventing Salmonella outbreaks and is probably an important reason for decreasing incidences in recent years. Tests and media used for identification of Salmonella take advantage of unique aspects of Salmonella physiology or biochemistry relative to other genera within the Enterobacteriaceae family. For example, bacteria from the genus Salmonella are mostly facultative anaerobes, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive and Gram-negative rods.

The Bacillus cereus group comprises Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cytotoxicus and some other species, which share about 3100 genes. Some strains can cause foodborne illness similar to those caused by Clostridium perfringens or Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum infective dose is about 10^6-10^7 bacteria/g, at that range of cell concentration they start to build different toxins which cause both diarrheal and emetic human gastrointestinal syndromes. One of the infection sources for the diarrhea type of B. cereus infection are UHT milk products. Contamination of raw milk occurs by simple transfer during milking when hygiene conditions are not fully observed. If present in raw milk, spores can survive the pasteurization process and contaminate the finished milk product. In milk products, B. cereus and other bacilli can degrade the casein to peptides which may be further degraded to amino acids which are responsible for alkaline reaction and a bitter taste in milk.

Bifidobacterium is one of the most important probiotic bacteria used in the dairy industry. Bifidobacteria have a positive effect on the immune system and control intestinal pH. Additionally, they produce bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like inhibitory compounds which inhibit the growth of other bacteria. ISO 22981:2010 describes the enumeration of presumptive Bifidobacteria by the TOS-MUP agar. Our 100043 TOS-MUP agar is in accordance with this ISO standard and is highly selective for Bifidobacteria as it suppresses the growth of Lactobacilli. Our chromogenic Bifidobacteria Selective Media allows for easy and fast quality control of yogurt: Lactobacilli belong to the lactic acid bacteria and comprise the major part of this group. As their name implies, they produce lactic acid. The acid-producing mechanism inhibits growth of other organisms and favors the growth of Lactobacilli that thrive in low pH environments.

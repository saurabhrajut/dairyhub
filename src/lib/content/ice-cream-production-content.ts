                <h4>C. Homogenization</h4><p>Immediately after pasteurization, the hot ice cream mix is subjected to homogenization. This process breaks down fat globules, ensuring a stable fat emulsion.</p>
                <h4>D. Aging</h4><p>Following homogenization, the ice cream mix is cooled and held at 2°C to 5°C for 4 to 24 hours. This crucial step allows for fat crystallization and full hydration of proteins and stabilizers.</p>
                <h4>E. Freezing & Overrun</h4><p>The freezing stage is where the liquid ice cream mix transforms into a semi-solid, aerated product. Overrun is the percentage of volume expansion achieved from the amount of air incorporated, significantly affecting texture and profitability.</p>
                <h4>F. Adding Inclusions</h4><p>After the initial freezing phase, when the ice cream is still semi-frozen, inclusions like liquid flavors, fruit purees, chocolate chips, or nuts are added.</p>
                <h4>G. Hardening</h4><p>The final critical freezing step is hardening, where the semi-frozen ice cream is rapidly brought to very low temperatures, typically -30°C or lower. This freezes out remaining water and stabilizes the structure.</p>`
